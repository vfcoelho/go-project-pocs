//TODO: use new suite pattern to create integration tests for api and worker - add scenarios to show different use cases we could use the new custom error type and middlewares to handle error recovery, treatment and logging
/*
- a case for each use case in the api
- a case for each use case in the worker - replicate use cases from the api, but in the worker context
*/
